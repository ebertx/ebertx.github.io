[*Luther*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luther_(TV_series)) has been on my "to watch" list for some time now. It's a no-brainer, really. It appeals to both my Anglophilia and my enjoyment of crime dramas.

The movie *Se7en* clearly influences *Luther*. Both take place in worn out, broken down, sparsely populated, degenerate urban settings. If you enjoy those slideshows of old neighborhoods in Detroit falling apart and completely devoid of life, *Luther* feels a lot like that. The game *Condemned: Criminal Origins* is another point of comparison.

One aspect that I particularly enjoyed was seeing some of London's interior architecture. *Luther* takes place largely in either apartment complexes or industrial areas. I don't know how representative of London the filming locations were, but I found many of the structures interesting to look at. 

The bleak environment makes the deviant crimes portrayed seem less far-fetched. However, multiple times throughout the series, a criminal commits some shocking act of violence in a relatively crowded area and no one does anything. In one particular scene, a man walks into a busy office complex and begins attacking people with a hammer and squirt-gun filled with acid. 

 In reality, I don't think a large group of people is quite so helpless against one man with a hammer. This begs the question, Why are people portrayed as being completely helpless against criminals? Is that a commonly held view in England? Is it lazy writing? I'm really curious what the answer could possibly be.
