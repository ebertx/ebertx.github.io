I picked up the first *Titanfall* about a year ago after it went on sale for five dollars. I had looked forward to playing to, but had never gotten around to it for whatever reason. At five bucks I felt I had run out of reasons to put it off. What I found was an incredibly fast-paced FPS that felt more like UT2K4 did then anything I have played in the last 10 years. *Titanfall 2*'s release date soon found itself in my calendar.

The original *Titanfall* had an intriguing universe, but the lack of a real campaign limited the player to only a vague impression, not anything concrete. *Titanfall 2* remedies this with a complete campaign that provides much more information about who's fighting whom and for what reasons.

Someone associated with *Titanfall 2* said it was more like *Half-Life* than *Call of Duty*. I would say it's more of a blend of *Half-Life*, *Call of Duty*, as well as *Mirror's Edge*. Of course the game has plenty of combat, but it also has numerous, lengthy sections of environment traversal that has similar pacing to *Half-Life*, but gameplay-wise is more reminiscent of *Mirror's Edge*.

Wall-running plays a huge part in the game. It featured in the first *Titanfall*, as well, but not to the degree it does here. In fact, the campaign seems to act as training to let the player know just how advantageous wall-running can be for speedily traveling from one end of the map to another. 

As intriguing as the *Titanfall* universe was in the first game, it felt much more generic in the second. I'm being vague, but the first felt more epic somehow, more akin to *Warhammer 40k*, for instance. While the 2nd has epic set-pieces and epic battles, the universe itself feels smaller. 

In terms of multiplayer, the gameplay is very similar. Again, there seems to be a bigger emphasis on wall-running, which is a game in and of itself. Most of the modes are a variant of deathmatch or team deathmatch, with the exception of Capture the Flag. It lacks the Frontier Defense mode that was added later on in the first *Titanfall*. Hopefully Frontier Defense will be added later, as it would be a nice change of pace from all of the deathmatch modes.

Despite all the quibbles, *Titanfall 2* delivers a uniquely fast-paced, elegant, and frequently frenetic gameplay that adds freshness to an established genre.
