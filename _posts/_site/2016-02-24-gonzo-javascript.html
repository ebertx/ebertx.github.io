<p>The defining characteristic of the current world of javascript is insanity. New front-end frameworks pop up at an alarming rate, and everyone dutifully learns why A is better than B is scenario X, but C and B are both marginally better than A in scenario Y. The insanity has proceeded for a number of years now, and now a new diatribe can be expected to pop up on Hacker News a least once a month describing the fatigue of playing framework whack-a-mole. </p>

<p>With the popularity and corporate backing of Angular and React, I genuinely thought 2015 would be the end of the front-end framework wars. Not that an individual victor had emerged, but the borders had seemed to <em>stabilize</em>.</p>

<p>Peace no longer seems right around the corner. So instead of hoping for peace, I will embrace insanity. I plan on approaching developments in the world of javascript the way Hunter S. Thompson approached a story: I will dive in with no illusion of objectivity.</p>
