<p>In anticipation of the new <em>Gilmore Girls</em>, I’ve been going through a list of some of the better episodes from the original run. Broadcast from 2000-2007, it ended right around the time smartphones came out. What strikes me as interesting is how tone deaf the show is to the internet, both technologically and culturally. It reminds me of one of my favorite shows, <em>NewsRadio</em>, which had a similar obliviousness. <em>NewsRadio</em>, however, came out in the mid-90s, so it had a bit more of an excuse.</p>

<p>Part of it stems from the writers being out of touch with youth. You look at the way teenagers are portrayed and you realize that the teenagers you are looking at are not approximations of real life teenagers, but a bizarre projection of the adult writers’ ideal version of a teenager. For example, the genre of rap music is completely non-existent. All of the teenagers listen to punk, alternative, college rock, etc. </p>

<p>It doesn’t detract too much from the show, but I wonder how much change to expect in the portrayal of technology in the upcoming series. The 1990s and 2000s may have been peak internet ignorance. I’m assuming by now even the most insulated people have more or less caught up.</p>
