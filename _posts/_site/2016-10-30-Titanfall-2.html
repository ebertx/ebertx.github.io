<p><em>Black Mirror</em> does a remarkable job of taking current technologies or trends and extrapolating them just to the brink of absurdity. Each episode leaves the viewer wondering whether or not it could possibly happen. </p>

<p><em>Nosedive</em> takes the concept of digital social reputation, melds it with the ubiquity and inescapability of credit scores, and turns the whole thing up to 11. It follows one woman’s attempt at climbing the social ladder via improving her score, which results in a number of both funny and depressing interactions.</p>

<p>Unlike previous episodes of <em>Black Mirror</em>, I felt like in this one the concept didn’t really warrant a full hour. The content of the episode felt stretched thin to fill the full hour. Also, uncharacteristic of other episodes, this one had what could loosely be interpreted as having an ending with a silver lining. Sort of.</p>

<p>Overall, the episode still shows all the core strengths of <em>Black Mirror</em>, but I hope the next episodes are better.</p>
