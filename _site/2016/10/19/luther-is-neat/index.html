  <h1 class="post-title">Luther is neat</h1>
  <span class="post-date">19 Oct 2016</span>
  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luther_(TV_series)"><em>Luther</em></a> has been on my “to watch” list for some time now. It’s a no-brainer, really. It appeals to both my Anglophilia and my enjoyment of crime dramas.</p>

<p>The movie <em>Se7en</em> clearly influences <em>Luther</em>. Both take place in worn out, broken down, sparsely populated, degenerate urban settings. If you enjoy those slideshows of old neighborhoods in Detroit falling apart and completely devoid of life, <em>Luther</em> feels a lot like that. The game <em>Condemned: Criminal Origins</em> is another point of comparison.</p>

<p>One aspect that I particularly enjoyed was seeing some of London’s interior architecture. <em>Luther</em> takes place largely in either apartment complexes or industrial areas. I don’t know how representative of London the filming locations were, but I found many of the structures interesting to look at. </p>

<p>The bleak environment makes the deviant crimes portrayed seem less far-fetched. However, multiple times throughout the series, a criminal commits some shocking act of violence in a relatively crowded area and no one does anything. In one particular scene, a man walks into a busy office complex and begins attacking people with a hammer and squirt-gun filled with acid. </p>

<p>In reality, I don’t think a large group of people is quite so helpless against one man with a hammer. This begs the question, Why are people portrayed as being completely helpless against criminals? Is that a commonly held view in England? Is it lazy writing? I’m really curious what the answer could possibly be.</p>
