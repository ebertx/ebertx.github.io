  <h1 class="post-title">Titanfall 2</h1>
  <span class="post-date">30 Oct 2016</span>
  <p>I picked up the first <em>Titanfall</em> about a year ago after it went on sale for five dollars. I had looked forward to playing to, but had never gotten around to it for whatever reason. At five bucks I felt I had run out of reasons to put it off. What I found was an incredibly fast-paced FPS that felt more like UT2K4 did then anything I have played in the last 10 years. <em>Titanfall 2</em>’s release date soon found itself in my calendar.</p>

<p><img src="/public/img/tf2-clouds.jpg" alt="Hope you like wall-running" title="Titanfall 2 platforming" /></p>

<p>The original <em>Titanfall</em> had an intriguing universe, but the lack of a real campaign limited the player to only a vague impression, not anything concrete. <em>Titanfall 2</em> remedies this with a complete campaign that provides much more information about who’s fighting whom and for what reasons.</p>

<p>Someone associated with <em>Titanfall 2</em> said it was more like <em>Half-Life</em> than <em>Call of Duty</em>. I would say it’s more of a blend of <em>Half-Life</em>, <em>Call of Duty</em>, as well as <em>Mirror’s Edge</em>. Of course the game has plenty of combat, but it also has numerous, lengthy sections of environment traversal that has similar pacing to <em>Half-Life</em>, but gameplay-wise is more reminiscent of <em>Mirror’s Edge</em>.</p>

<p>Wall-running plays a huge part in the game. It featured in the first <em>Titanfall</em>, as well, but not to the degree it does here. In fact, the campaign seems to act as training to let the player know just how advantageous wall-running can be for speedily traveling from one end of the map to another. </p>

<p>As intriguing as the <em>Titanfall</em> universe was in the first game, it felt much more generic in the second. I’m being vague, but the first felt more epic somehow, more akin to <em>Warhammer 40k</em>, for instance. While the 2nd has epic set-pieces and epic battles, the universe itself feels smaller. </p>

<p>In terms of multiplayer, the gameplay is very similar. Again, there seems to be a bigger emphasis on wall-running, which is a game in and of itself. Most of the modes are a variant of deathmatch or team deathmatch, with the exception of Capture the Flag. It lacks the Frontier Defense mode that was added later on in the first <em>Titanfall</em>. Hopefully Frontier Defense will be added later, as it would be a nice change of pace from all of the deathmatch modes.</p>

<p>Despite all the quibbles, <em>Titanfall 2</em> delivers a uniquely fast-paced, elegant, and frequently frenetic gameplay that adds freshness to an established genre.</p>
